# Movie app (idk what else to call it)
This is a simple webpage that I mostly made for practice. Learning React and TypeScript.
It fetches the most popular movies from a database using API calls, and shows them on the home page.
It lets you favorite movies, which persist across browser sessions using localStorage.
You can also search for any movie, and favorite it as well.
This project has no other functionality, and I don't plan on doing anything more with it.
